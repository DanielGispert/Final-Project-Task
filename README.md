Hello Pau, this project was made by Daniel Gispert and Víctor Medina Pérez.
We tryied our best but it is true that maybe this class for the english matter is a bit hard :), even though I think we made quite something.
It is very frustating how a lot of times the thigs didn't work as we thout should have and had to change files to other places, call them in other
ways etc.

We recomend you to download and try it in desktop version because there are some things that in verecel doesn't work and we can't manage to make it work.

It was a pleasure. Have a nice summer.
